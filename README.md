Hello and welcome to "Enviro Safe" . 

<i> How to hack the environment , by Jacob R. Thompson </i>

My name is (Jaykey) Jacob Thompson. Here you will find the basic layout and functions of html and css to incorporate a simple enviro safe draft to be incorporated with hedera and hashgraph.  

Essentially enviro safe takes the enviromnent into its own hands by the adaptation of several already available technologies, That will be referenced later.  
Please note the essential function and purpose of enviro safe and that is to move towards decarbonization in an appropriate way. For Enviro Safe, This means keeping the environment safe and of couse / therefore green. 
There is a new and essential measurement known as GPF or Greenery per foot.  

it works like this --Enviro Safe makes Enviro Ledgers. Enviro Ledgers are essentially tokens over time of green contribution to the environment.  Within a given GPS Coordinates , this can be measured and improved on as a whole if not a specific area. 
However, Enviro Safe works on Enviro Ledgers to keep the Enviro Safe and Green , one spot at a time. 
Essentially rewarding gardeners in a sense, but directing it into the GPF or Greenery per foot. 

Please , Let me show you ,  

Enviro Ledgers are simply claims for a certain area , 
 - - Be a already green or just wasted ground.
 to maintain a certain GPF.   
 *** Note *** This is within a time constraint. 
 *** Note *** This can be either to Increase OR Maintain the Environment on the requested ledger.
 *** Note *** Requested ledgers Will work in a DAO organized fashion with 
 -orders in- and -filled orders- of ledgers
 
 ----Envoiro Safe ---
 - Strict Ledger Requirements -
 - #1. a four pointed GPS Coordinates
 - #2. a Reasonable or expected GPF,  aka ( Greenery Per Foot).
 - #3. A given time frame ex 30days , for which to maintain or improve designated coordinates.
 - --#4. A reasonable Enviro Safe Determination and Transfer or Enviro Safe Token ,
 - for pay out to accepted ledger and user/Representative.

#5 and most important, upon growth this will grow into a DAO organization controlled by its owners , until then Enviro Safe
will simply charge temporary 5% per Enviro Safe ledger requested for growth.  
If a Enviro Safe Rep is to be requested , a minimun token requirement must be established.
